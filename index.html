    Hey Lads how are you, So as you Lads can see I am working on The Server to make The MC server, now that I have the
    <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>, Ubuntu.
    I will be Migrating the Website hosting directory, from github to the Server (Ubuntu).
    There are many reasons why I am doing this, one of them is to have more control over hosting the website, like
    making a <abbr title="Domain Name">DN</abbr> so you Lads
    wont have to remember the overly complicated Domain Name ( <abbr title="joshito1.github.io/mcw.github.io">The
      current default DN</abbr> ).
    So The website will still be hosted here until I complete the server. I am unable to estimate when I will finish and
    migrate the website but I will update you Lads once I am
    close enough to finishing the server, so do check in every Friday when you are able too. Thank you Lads and hope are
    doing well and having a great day/night.
  </p>

      Hello There Lads! Hope You are doing well and having an amazing day!
      <div\>

        <div class="text">
          I Welcome you To.. The MC Lads Website! In here I will be putting
          information dedicated To both servers; The MC Dedicated Server and The
          Server itself. Also other cool pages will be posted! but we'll have to
          see what those things will be, Because I still dont know what theyll be,
          hehe (nervous laugh). This is a preveiw of the website, so you guys can
          test it out and let me know how it goes or runs! There will be changes
          along the way so somethings are still under development, but they should
          be quick to code (programmer humor there.. hehe, nothings quick to code).
          So do please give suggestions or ideas on what we could put on the website.
          So I hope you enjoy this website and hope you enjoy your rest of your day :D
