        Hello There Lads! Hope You are doing well and having an amazing day!
      </div\>

      <div class="text">
        I Welcome you To.. The MC Lads Website! In here I will be putting
        information dedicated To both servers; The MC Dedicated Server and The
        Server itself. Also other cool pages will be posted! but we'll have to
        see what those things will be, Because I still dont know what theyll be,
        hehe (nervous laugh). This is a preveiw of the website, so you guys can
        test it out and let me know how it goes or runs! There will be changes
        along the way so somethings are still under development, but they should
        be quick to code (programmer humor there.. hehe, nothings quick to
        code). So do please give suggestions or ideas on what we could put on
        the website. So I hope you enjoy this website and hope you enjoy your
        rest of your day :D
