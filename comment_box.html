        The Comment Box!! It is of course under a bit of development, and doesnt
        quite work (Your post arent going to be saved nor are your posts going
        to be seen by others, so im sorry), but it works XD. Ok, this is how its
        going to work once it works as intended, so your opinions or suggestions
        are goiong to be typed Down below, and your comments should pop up on
        top once you submit your comment (This is where its at at the moment),
        and remember this is still under development and on experimental phases
        so you wont expect some high quality things.., yet. Alright Lads, I hope
        you enjoy this feature and quick reminder, Ill be updating the website
        once a while so do check every Friday or so. Alright have a good rest of
        your day Lads, goodbye!
