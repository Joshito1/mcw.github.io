        Ok so what I was saying about the nav bar is to basically just have every element of the nav bar inside one nav tag as shown down below. If you use more than one nav tag
        it ruins the whole purpose of the nav tag since usually websites only have one navigation header.
     -->
  <nav>
    <!-- I don't understand the purpose of the div here without a class name you could do the same thing without the extra div -->
    <!-- Also, unless absolutely neccessary I wouldn't have any css code in the html file  -->
    <!-- You don't need all of the extra ul tags either since you can put them all under the same tag -->
    <!-- This was a mistake I also did, you don't really need the li tags if they are links because I feel like it's just an extra tag that has no use. This is your choice tho
        and I think including the li tag is technically best practice I just don't see the use for it. -->
